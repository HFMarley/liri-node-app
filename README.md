# liri-node-app

As part of the University of Texas Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp we were challenged to create a LIRI Bot, similar to IPhones SIRI Bot. Instead of taking audible commands it takes written commands and then retrieves specific data for the user based on one of the following four commands: 

  * movie-this
  * spotify-this-song
  * concert-this
  * do-what-it-says

# Tech Incorporated

  * Node.js
  * javaScript
  * API Calls
  * Axios 
  * npm installs
  * package.json
  * moment.js

# Example Of What Each Command Does

1. node liri.js **movie-this** forrest gump
  * Title of the Movie
  * Year the movie came out
  * IMDB Rating of the movie
  * Country where the movie was produced
  * Language of the movie
  * Plot of the movie
  * Actors in the movie
  * Rotten Tomatoes Rating
  * Rotten Tomatoes URL

2. node liri.js **spotify-this-song** come together

  * The album that the song is from

3. node liri.js **concert-this** the black Angels
